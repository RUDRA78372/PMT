# PMT
PMT - Parallel Multithreaded encoder/decoder by 78372  Main Options: PMT2.exe e/d {Encoder} {Basic Options} Input Output e/d represents encode/decode input/output can be specified as "-" for stdin/stdout {Encoder} must be present both for encoding and decoding  Basic Options: -t#: Number of threads to use(Default: number of threads you have) -t#p:  Percentage of threads to use -b#: BlockSize(Encode only) (Default: 64m)  INI Options: PMT.ini is required for encoder/decoder The section name should be as the {Encoder} The keys should be as below: Encode = It should have the Encode Command Line Decode = It should have the Decode Command Line Infile = It should be the encode input file name for the {Encoder}. Default is p mtinfile.tmp. It will be the output file for decoding Outfile = It should be the encode output file name for the {Encoder}. Default is  pmtoutfile.tmp. It will be the input file for decoding You can not encode using PMT and decode directly using {Encoder} and vice versa Write &lt;stdin> or &lt;stdout> in Encode or Decode to specify stdin/stdout
